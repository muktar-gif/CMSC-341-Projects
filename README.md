# Adjacency Lists
Program is an implementation of a sparse adjancey list using a dynamic array of linked lists to represent the graph with weighted edges. The adjancey list also contains a custom iterator to loop through the edges as well as one to loop through neighbors.
# RMQ List
The program is an implementation of a Range Minimum Query. Using a linked list data structure with key and value pairs a precomputaion is done with a dynamic programming method allowing Î˜(1) query time.
# Splay Tree of Trees
Program is an implementation of a splay tree of a binary search tree with array rebalancing. Given a series of weights and corresponding characters the binary search tree will sort the characters by their weights. Each BST is then ordered by range within a splay tree. Once sorted the splay tree will result in an unscramble image and print a complete image
# Skew Heap Priority Queue
Program is an implementation of a skew heap.
